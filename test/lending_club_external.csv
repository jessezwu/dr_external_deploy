school  IΗm a hard worker and IΗm usually one of the top performers in the Austin area out of six clubs  Unfortunately my job only pays me enough to get by and never enough to get ahead  Overall IΗve enjoyed the gym experience for the most part but there are a few things that IΗve learned from working in a corporate environment  First IΗve learned that I want to work for myself and be my own boss  I donΗt have a problem with authority or following directions but sometimes I feel that IΗm not allowed to be creative and put my talents to full use  And though I like the gym industry and studied Exercise Science in college IΗve learned that the kind of money I want to make cannot be made there at least from an investment perspective  As long as I work there IΗll always be trading my hours for dollars building a business for someone else  I want to invest my time and make the work I do today give me a return at some point in the future  I want to build a business that works for me to be able to make money even when IΗm asleep  At any rate I am looking to get involved in real estate investing  IΗm not looking to quit my gym job but rather build wealth parttime until IΗm in a position to leave  I know that real estate investing is risky but I have done my research and also have a personal mentor and coach  To be effective in real estate though I need a small amount of startup capital  Every day I get so frustrated at the fact that I have the motivation desire and talent to make money but I dont have the financial means to get the ball rolling  Thats all I need  I just need a chance I hate having debt and this site was one of the last places I wanted to be  However IΗm willing to take a chance and work hard so I can get ahead  I worked throughout college selling kitchen knives so I could get out of school with minimal debt  I still maintained a 34 GPA and was involved in many organizations on campus  I feel Im responsible and am frugal when it comes to business expenditures  To give you an idea of the influences on my financial background I am taking Dave RamseyΗs Financial Peace University course  In case youΗre not familiar his advice is pretty straightforward and conservative and he teaches using a zerobased monthly cash flow plan where ΗΓevery dollar is spent before the month beginsΗ  So for me I only plan on spending money on bare necessities like a tax ID and business account  I also need to spend money on a personal training certification so I can begin training people  That way I can make the same amount of money I currently make but work less hours so I can spend more time on real estate  The rest I need to have available for real estate transactions  I have a plan and Im confident in my ability to execute Needless to

working on becoming an orthopedic surgeon  In the past 2006 I used Prosper to borrow money to fix up my 1971 Chevrolet Nova Muscle Car and was very pleased with the experience  I borrowed 3000 and paid it off in 12 months  I am now seeking 10750 to invest in US equities and will be paying off my loan in 36 months  I am an extremely hard working guy that was top of my class in college  I am a very low risk borrower as I have NEVER been late on a credit card payment or peertopeer lending payment  I have a lot going for me and will not risk messing up my credit or reputation by being late on any payments to a lender  I have recently been awarded a prestigious scholarship that will be paying for half of medical school and you can see my bio at httpwwwpdsorosorgcurrentfellows   The condensed version of my finances is that I have over 23000 in cash all of my vehicles are paid for and worth around 30000 owe 8000 on my credit cards that in combination with the fact that as a medical student I get a living allowance of 2500month I only use 1700 of it does not show up as income and causes me to have a low credit score go to medical school on a near fullride and have positive cash flow exceeding 800month after all my expenses are taken into account  I am getting married this summer and will be living on campus with my wife who just finished her Masters and is a college professor  Her income will cover groceries gas and other living expenses meaning that I foresee positive cash flow of over 1100month starting this fall I will also be selling two of my classic muscle cars this summer  You may ask why I have 8000 in credit card debt when I have 23000 in cash and 30000 in assets  That is because I have a 0 APR card and have wanted the cash cushion for now  I do not foresee any big expenses as I have already paid for the ring we have paid for the honeymoon and our parents are paying for the wedding I would just rather have that cash available right now as we start our new life together and as soon as my 0 APR deal ends I will pay the cards off  I will have more than enough positive cash flow each month to make the payment on this 10750 loan   During the summer break between my sophomore and junior years of college I did an investment banking internship and had the opportunity to learn about the world of economics and equities  Since then I have followed the world financial markets with a close eye and have become very passionate about investing This enormous downturn the worst since the Great Depression has left good companies in infrastructure tech agriculture shipping trading at a fraction of what they were  It has also removed a large amount of risk in investing and has presented an opportunity with enormous upside potential as a recovery looms on the horizon as has happened after every US economic crisis in history  In 2006 and 2007 I actively invested a sum of 10000 and turned it into 20000 through learning to manage risk with stops investing on a mixture of momentum news technical analysis and fundamentals not letting emotion greed or fear make me hold losing positions learning to sell my losses and ride my gains etc  I am happy that I sold everything before the crisis and was able to buy my dream car at the time with the proceeds in late 2007 2004 BMW 330Ci  Seeing this opportunity after the economic crisis and the recovery on the horizon next couple years has once again convinced me to start to move some money 5000 back into the market in the past month with a focus on managing risk with tight stops and have made some great profits already  I would like to increase the size of this portfolio as soon as possible with the proceeds from this loan,< 1 year,RENT,29950.0,not
